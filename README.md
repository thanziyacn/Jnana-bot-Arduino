# Jnana Bot – Multilingual Audio Information System

## 📖 About the Project
Jnana Bot is a multilingual audio information system developed as a First Year Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) group project.

The system is designed to play pre-recorded audio messages in different languages using push buttons. It is built using Arduino Uno and DF Mini Player. Audio files are stored in an SD card and played through a speaker when a specific button is pressed.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of embedded systems, microcontroller programming, hardware interfacing, and serial communication.

## ⚙ Working Principle
1. The push buttons are connected to Arduino digital pins.
2. When a button is pressed, Arduino detects the input.
3. Arduino sends a serial command to the DF Mini Player module.
4. The DF Mini Player plays the corresponding audio file stored in the SD card.
5. The audio is output through the speaker.
